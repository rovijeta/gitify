# github_user_profile_search
I have developed a tool that searches for GitHub user profile information. I have used the fetch API to retrieve the user's information and used the Dom API to alter the elements to display the information on UI. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop this tool.

Here is the link to the website for preview.
